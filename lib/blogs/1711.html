    <p class="para">Hi friends ðŸ‘‹,</p>
    <p class="para">Happy Monday! What a year the past week has been. </p>
    <p class="para">Iâ€™m not going to write a piece on FTX today, other than to touch on it briefly, not because I donâ€™t think itâ€™s an important story, but because itâ€™s been written about millions of times over the past week and I donâ€™t have much new to add. </p>
    <p class="para">FTX US sponsored Not Boring Founders and a couple of newsletter editions. I would never and will never work with a sponsor whose products I wouldnâ€™t use myself. I just got FTX wrong. I was so comfortable with FTX that when they asked to deposit my payment in my FTX US account instead of my bank account, I said yes without a second thought. I never imagined theyâ€™d become insolvent, and traded/kept funds in that account for months without a worry. I only avoided getting wiped out because I got lucky: I wanted to stake the ETH and MATIC I bought there, so I moved everything on-chain a couple of weeks ago. The story is ongoing, but it looks like FTX and SBF committed fraud, deceit, theft, and misuse of customer funds, and I hope that theyâ€™re held accountable, and that customer funds can be restored, to the fullest extent possible.</p>
    <p class="para">Mario Gabriele comes closest to my thoughts and feelings on the whole thing in his beautifully written The Casino and the Genie. Iâ€™m working on a bigger piece that in part explains why I think crypto is still valuable and inevitable for next week. </p>

    <p class="para"> Indirectly, though, this piece is about FTX, or the impact of its actions on belief. While itâ€™s hard to measure precisely, belief is one of the most important inputs to tech and crypto valuations, even though it /redirect/87b0614c-1425-406a-8a27-0d36869ceed7doesnâ€™t show up in a DCF model. </p>
        
    <p class="para"> Letâ€™s get to it.</p>
    
    <h2 class="herooo-heading">Discounting Belief</h2>
    <img class="i2-img" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a3fd5e-1870-4a38-ac28-e0e712a0db66_1200x600.png?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" >

    <h2 class="herooo-heading">What to Do When Belief Dries Up</h2>


    <p class="para">Writing all of this out has given me a new perspective on all of the cost cutting measures and pivots to profitability in the tech and startup ecosystem. On the surface, they look like survival tactics â€“ keep burn low so you donâ€™t run out of money while funding is harder to come by, get to profitability so you control your own destiny â€“ and they are, but theyâ€™re more than that. Theyâ€™re the rational moves. </p>

    <p class="para">In this environment, cash flows next year are worth a lot more relative to cash flows in ten years than they were just a year ago. Cutting costs and making moves to get profitable sooner, even at the expense of long-term cash flows, makes sense. </p>
        
    <p class="para"> I said earlier that everyone was drunk on low rates last year, but hiring more people to work on moonshot projects that might pay off in five years may have actually made sober sense when the Belief Rate was higher and the discount rate was lower. Now that the Belief Rate is lower, focusing on shorter-term wins that donâ€™t require much investor belief can make sense. </p>
        
    <p class="para">Some of the biggest, most impactful ideas just wonâ€™t be able to get profitable in the near future. Thereâ€™s new tech to develop, supply chains to set up, and long sales cycles to contend with. If you still have the urge to go big, and I hope that many of you do, you need to provide as much concrete evidence that youâ€™re making progress towards your huge, crazy vision as possible. Hit milestones, be explicit about every step of the plan, hire brilliantly, be hawkish about unit economics. Make investors apply a higher Belief Rate to your company than theyâ€™re applying to the market through your actions.</p>
        
    <p class="para">But for the average company, the one with a product in market and customers paying, itâ€™s rational to tighten your belt in this environment, dilute yourself as little as possible, bank belief, and preserve optionality in order to accelerate when discount rates come back down and Belief Rates shoot up again. </p>
        
    <p class="para"> That said, there are pockets in which the Belief Rate is still high. Generative AI is the obvious example here. In October, Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, raised a round at a $1 billion valuation. The same week, AI content platform Jasper announced a $125 million Series A at a $1.5 billion valuation. Presumably, most of Stability and Jaspersâ€™ cash flow will come very far in the future, but investors were willing to apply a high Belief Rate to each. Why? </p>
        
    <p class="para">Iâ€™m not exactly sure, but my best guess is that there are a couple of factors. First, this generative AI boom was born in the bear market and wasnâ€™t tainted by overhype in the bull market. Itâ€™s shiny and new when so much looks beaten down. Second, as belief in incumbents tumbles, it looks like thereâ€™s a real opportunity (and appetite) for a new paradigm, and a consensus forming that the next Google and Facebook will be built AI-native. Third, the size of the opportunity is so large that itâ€™s possible to arrive at a billion-dollar valuation even with a lower Belief Rate; itâ€™s easy to imagine these valuations would have been even higher in mid-2021. Fourth, the technology is mind-blowingly cool, and it makes people want to believe. And finally, even in a bear market, people want to believe in something. </p>
        
    <p class="para"> More broadly, while venture funding has cooled significantly, and prices for deals that do get done have come down, this isnâ€™t the end of tech. Massive companies will very likely be built during this bear market. With layoffs and hiring freezes at big tech companies, startups will have the chance to build all-star teams at affordable prices. Huge categories are being transformed. Cost curves are coming down. Founders are still dreaming big.</p>
        
    <p class="para"> And some companies still deserve a high Belief Rate. Some companies will do exactly what they say theyâ€™re going to do. Some companies will even exceed their own optimistic projections. </p>
        
        
        
    <p class="para">Whether in a year or a decade, valuations will rise, big companies will be created, and belief will be restored. For whenever that happens, note to self: Donâ€™t Stop Believing is a better song than it is a trading strategy. </p>
