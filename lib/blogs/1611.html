<p class=" para">I woke up that day as usual. Made myself a cup of chai. Read a few pages of the book I was on. Cleaned up. Then read some more. It wasn’t an early day at work so spent some extra timing choosing which tee to wear. Drove to work an hour later not knowing what was waiting for me there.</p>

<small class="date"> <u>12 noon:</u> </small>
 
<p class="para">The beginnings of my days at work are so well rehearsed. I made myself another cup of chai, ordered breakfast, updated my to-do list and opened my laptop to check on emails. The subject line of the email, third from top, was ‘Invitation to Participate in the YouTube Creators For Change Program.’ I read the email calmly not knowing what was going to unfold in the next few months.</p>

    <br>

    <small class="date"> <u>1:00pm:</u> </small>
 
    <p class="para">It took me sometime to quite understand what the email meant. Spoke to the team and replied positively. I remember being happy to be qualified to apply for a program like this. Selection wasn’t even on my mind!</p>
    
    <p class="para">I had a bunch of work lined up that day. So pat myself on the back for making it to the selection round and got to work. Not knowing that 2 weeks from then I was going to get a confirmation, making me one of the 4 Creators For Change Ambassadors from my country.</p>

<br>
    <br>
    <br>

<small class="date"> <u>8:00pm::</u> </small>
 
<p class="para">I made a few work calls, had another cup of chai, brainstormed for a few video ideas, checked on my schedule for the remainder of the week, packed my things and left for home. Not knowing that the email I replied to this morning was going to take me on this crazy ride of content creation, writing, dancing, laughing, travelling and most importantly, making an impact. Not knowing how many crazy, incredible opportunities were making their way towards me. Not knowing how many mad lessons I was about to learn. Not knowing how much I was about to grow as a person. Not knowing how many great friends I was about to make.</p>

<small class="date"> <u>10:00pm::</u> </small>
 
<p class="para">Had a quite dinner with Mamma and Baba and got in bed. Not knowing that this very day, my life had changed forever.
