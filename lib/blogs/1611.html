<p class="para">I was shocked to see my college after so many days because of the second wave of the Corona Virus. I get to the canteen and took another cup of coffee and ordered my favourite idly, dosa as a brunch, I had to meet few of my faculties so started meeting them one after another. It was so funny and exciting to meet them in person because it was approx a year and falf, and half of them were not recognising me. </p>

    <small class="date"> <u>1:00pm:</u> </small>
 
    <p class="para">Suddenly I got a call from our NCC ANO that we need to meet them in his cabin. I was little scared  to hear him talk like that. </p>
    
    <p class="para">Reached his cabin, he wasn't there. I tried calling him and was told to wait. He came back half an hour later and he told us to take Ragda for juniors. After that he told us that to write C Certificate you have to have atleast a sortie this year. Okay!! so i'll explain what sortie is , Sortie is Flying. Yessss I was an NCC Air Wing Cadet so I was about to get a chance to sit in cockpit and fly an aircraft with the pilot. i took sometime to process it. It was all very unpredictable because of the covid outbreak that we were seeing from the very past year.</p>

<small class="date"> <u>8:00pm::</u> </small>
 
<p class="para">Later that I took Ragda for juniors and came back to my place i was  super excited because when I was a kid I had this in mind that I will only sit on a plane on my own and that was one of my reason to join NCC Air Wing(to fly an aircraft) was going to be true in some days. I started reading more about the aircraft that i was about to fly in my training.   </p>

<small class="date"> <u>10:00pm::</u> </small>
 
<p class="para">Had a quite dinner and spoke to Mamma and Baba and told them everything that happend today, They were also super happy after hearing this as none of them also had a chance to even sit on a plane...
